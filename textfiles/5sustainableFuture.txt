<p>A sustainable future</p>

<p>In 2012, the benchmark for landfill diversion for all campuses in the UC was 75 percent, which was met by UCLA. Rates of waste that did not end up in a landfill in 2013 were measured at more than 80 percent.</p>

<p>With greater recycling endeavors comes the necessity to create new ways to divert campus waste.</p>

<p>"Pretty much all the low-hanging fruit has been picked and now it's getting into the nitty-gritty, the actual changing of programs, asking what else can we do," Escobar said.</p>

<p>With the help of an action research team, Escobar is currently in the process of collecting and organizing data using geographic information systems. The information about the recycling and trash cans on campus is being used in order to develop specific and adaptable waste management systems for different areas of campus. The action research team is also charged with making recommendations to clarify the unclear signage on the bins, which often leads to waste being thrown in the wrong containers.</p>

<p>Recycling efforts to push UCLA toward its zero waste goal include both the introduction of more compost bins where food waste is more prevalent, and the piloting of zero waste programs in some of the facilities on campus.</p>

<p>Escobar said education remains one of the major goals of sustainability personnel on campus. He said getting through to people not only that they should recycle, but the reasoning behind it, is vital.</p>

<p>"By this point, everybody's heard about recycling. It's been beaten into our heads our entire life," Escobar said. "I think that the biggest challenge is finding that trigger to motivate them." Because while the process starts with a bottle thrown in a bin, it only works if it's the right one.</p>
