<p>The process begins with a bottle tossed absentmindedly into a recycling bin.</p>

<p>But this is only the beginning of its journey. Along with the rest of UCLA's massive amounts of waste, it will interact with multiple coordinating organizations and sometimes travel thousands of miles.</p>

<p>The double-barreled bins have become ubiquitous on campus, beckoning people to throw their plastic bottles, aluminum cans or scrunched-up midterms into the designated container.</p>

<p>Each of the more than 300 trash and recycling bins that litter the university is marked with the same goal: zero-waste by 2020.</p>

<p>"It's a bit ambitious," said Jesse Escobar, UCLA's recycling coordinator. "But I think we can do it."</p>

<p>Zero-waste is a plan of action for UCLA and the rest of the University of California to divert 100 percent of its waste away from landfills using techniques that include bolstered recycling practices.</p>

<p>Inside the bin, the bottle is collected, along with the rest of the recyclables, in a clear plastic bag –the clear plastic is part of the color coding systems that are pervasive in recycling and waste management.</p>

<p>From there, the bags are collected by UCLA facilities management personnel, often driving the white square-paneled metal carts seen buzzing around the university's pathways. The carts putter to a stop at one of the numerous docks associated with specific buildings or one of three centralized pick up locations scattered in the lots and backends of campus.</p>

<p>Loads of bags are then dumped into either a recycling compactor or a three-yard metal bin – both color coded blue – to await pickup.</p>

<p>Athens Services, a company that specializes in waste management and recycling services, picks up the compactors and bins from campus. But instead of bringing them to the company's own facility, it instead takes them to a small yard off a nondescript street in Santa Monica.</p>

<p>The trucks pull into the location cluttered with waylaid shipping containers and compacted bales of cans stacked like multicolored metallic brick. This is the home of one of the Allan Company's sorting facilities.</p>

<p>Once there, workers from the Allan Company, a recycling company active in Southern and Central California, evaluate the recyclables taken from UCLA by taking samples and measuring for contaminates.</p>

<p>They then pay a set price for the materials, effectively buying the tons of bottles, cans and paper products generated by the multitudes of people who traverse campus.</p>

<p>In the back of the yard, an immense mound of those same recyclables raises up more than 20 feet high and is picked at by scavenging birds.</p>

<p>The amalgam of detergent bottles, manila envelopes and water bottles is a result of single-stream recycling, which many have touted as the way forward to increase consumer recycling.</p>
