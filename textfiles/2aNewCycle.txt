<p>The increase in recycling efforts at UCLA, however, goes along with an understanding that recycling itself isn't the best thing to do for sustainability.</p>

<p>"There is a hierarchy in terms of action," said Nurit Katz, UCLA's chief sustainability officer. "With recycling you still have to use other resources and energy in order to take the materials and transform them into other materials."</p>

<p>Katz said a switch to single-stream recycling has made it easier for both members of the campus community and waste management employees to deal with recycling at UCLA.</p>

<p>Single-stream recycling is a system in which all common recyclable materials, like paper, plastic and aluminum, are collected together in the same bin and by extension mixed in the same collection truck.</p>

<p>Katz said before the introduction of single-stream recycling, multiple bins were used for different types of recycling, making it more difficult and inconvenient for students.</p>

<p>Rudy Martin, plant supervisor of the Allan Company's Santa Monica location, said single-stream recycling has practically doubled the amount of material that the location takes in.</p>

<p>However, some are more skeptical of practices like single-stream recycling which emphasize convenience over cautiousness.</p>

<p>The mass of material being sent to sorting plants inevitably leads to unwanted materials getting into the wrong waste streams, said Jerry Powell, executive editor of Resource Recycling, a trade magazine for the recycling industry. For example, wood and non-recyclable materials can get packed in and hidden under huge volumes of paper.</p>

<p>"Single-stream gets more pounds, gets more people to do it, but ends up with more contamination," Powell said. "It's a trade-off."</p>

<p>From the mound, workers pull out and sort material according to different grades, or different categories of recyclable materials, Martin said. Higher grades correspond to higher-value material.</p>

<p>The top grades are nonfibrous materials such as aluminum cans and plastic bottles. Among the lower-value fibrous materials are items like cardboard and paper.</p>

<p>Even within these categories there are distinctions.</p>

<p>The amount of money that can be received by recycling companies for various grades is related to how much investment is needed to return them back to commodities that can be remade as new products -- often in far away locations like China.</p>

<p>Once the materials are sorted into the various grades, they are baled, stacked and sent out to vendors both domestically and overseas.</p>

<p>A plastic bottle thrown into one of UCLA's recycling bins is likely to end up halfway around the world, used as manufacturing material in China.</p>

<p>According to data from the United States International Trade Commission, scrap and waste was one of the leading exports from the U.S. to China in 2013, netting more than $10 billion.</p>

<p>Because of Southern California's major ports like the Port of Los Angeles and the Port of Long Beach, much of the state's recycling goes to companies in China.</p>

<p>China holds around a 25 percent market share in U.S. recyclables, meaning one out of every four pounds goes to China, Powell said. In California, one out of every two pounds does.</p>

<p>Powell said China enacted a policy called Operation Green Fence to reject shipping containers that contain too much contamination, after companies used to use shipping containers to send trash and other unwanted materials along with desired recyclables. This led to a marked drop in exports of materials last year.</p>

<p>Despite environmental concerns, trade is integral to both nations' economic prosperity. The scraps and waste that get sent over to China are used as raw materials for new products that get exported back into the United States.</p>

<p>"It's a bit more complicated than this, but the materials we send there, the majority comes right back to us as finished products," Powell said. "Everything from the phone on your desk to the shoebox that packages your new Nikes."</p>
