<p>Electronic waste</p>

<p>Say there's a gummed-up keyboard or an old 20-pound monitor from a professor's office that needs to be recycled. Here things get a little trickier.</p>

<p>Electronic waste -- commonly known as e-waste -- is not considered municipal solid waste because of different requirements for its disposal.</p>

<p>Regardless, there are many efforts to recycle the tons of electronics that get discarded at UCLA.</p>

<p>Unpowered casings of old TVs and computers idle on huge pallets on the grounds of a decommissioned military base in Irvine, the final resting place for most of the 10 to 16 tons of e-waste produced monthly on campus.</p>

<p>UCLA's e-waste is sorted and processed at E-Recycling of California in Paramount, then sent to Irvine, said Maureen Craine, vice president of marketing and business development of e-Recycling of California, a company that handles more than 90 percent of UCLA's e-waste.</p>

<p>The process by which electronic waste gets recycled varies based on the kind of material that is sent to the site.</p>

<p>Take an old computer monitor as an example.</p>

<p>The process starts by using things like the serial number to try and identify the make, model and original purchasing location of the product.</p>

<p>From there the monitor gets separated into individual parts. The outer housing unit is torn away from the cathode ray tube, the part that creates the image on the screen. At this point, workers and machines start separating and processing different parts of the monitor, splitting up plastics, metals and glass into categories.</p>

<p>The cathode ray tubes, the most valuable component of the unit, are sent to a smelter that heats the part at temperatures up to 25,000 degrees to remove lead from the tubes.</p>

<p>These unleaded tubes are then generally sold overseas. In India, there is a big market for unleaded cathode ray tubes, Craine said.</p>

<p>Craine said there are specific concerns about ethical electronic recycling because of hazardous materials that go into electronics. Electronic waste often contains toxic chemicals such as the lead in cathode ray tubes.</p>

<p>Barbara Kyle, national coordinator of the Electronics TakeBack Coalition, which promotes responsible recycling in the electronics industry, said many e-waste recycling companies send their waste to developing countries, where it often ends up in outdoor backyard recycling operations close to residential areas.</p>

<p>"There is little in terms of regulations," Kyle said. "Even when a company says they follow all local and federal law, it doesn't mean much since there almost aren't any."</p>

<p>The lack of official regulation has led to attempts by independent organizations to create a voluntary standard for responsible electronic recycling.</p>

<p>E-Recycling of California's Irvine site is certified under the e-Stewards certification program, which gives companies assistance and audits their recycling processes.</p>

<p>Although e-Recycling of California handles electronic recycling of campus electronics, personal e-waste recycling for students, staff and faculty is not covered.</p>

<p>UCLA hosts a S.A.F.E. collection center located on Charles E. Young Drive, for collection of household waste and e-waste, but it only accepts electronic waste one day a week.</p>

<p>E3: Ecology, Economy, Equity, an environmental group at UCLA, has created a program to make up for this gap in the collection of personal e-waste.</p>

<p>The club applied for a grant with the Green Initiative Fund in 2012 to provide the plastic e-waste collection tubs seen in various locations on the Hill and campus, said Jenna Hoover, an e-waste coordinator with E3 and a second-year economics student.</p>
