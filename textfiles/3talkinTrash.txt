<p>Talkin' Trash</p>

<p>So the plastic bottle thrown away might just turn into a cellphone in a couple of years, but what happens if a recyclable is instead thrown into the trash?</p>

<p>The process starts out pretty much the same. The material gets collected – this time in black bags instead of clear ones – and dumped into tan-colored bins and trash compactors in centralized locations around campus.</p>

<p>Similarly to recyclables, Athens Services picks up the material, takes it to their facility in La Puente, about 45 minutes east of UCLA and practically adjacent to the recently-closed Puente Hills Landfill, the largest one in the U.S.</p>

<p>Materials sent to the facility first start by going through a process called materials recovery, where workers pick through the stream of waste and remove potentially valuable recyclables.</p>

<p>So that plastic bottle might get picked up there, but it's not likely.</p>

<p>Escobar said percentage of materials that actually ends up recycled, is more than 90 percent for the recycling compactors sent to Allan Company in Santa Monica. The trash compactors instead hover around 30 percent.</p>

<p>If the bottle goes undetected, there are two options. Either it gets sent to a landfill in San Bernardino County or it goes through a process called waste transformation, which in Athens case means the burning of waste.</p>

<p>Waste transformation is one of the many techniques being used to reach UCLA's zero-waste goal and 100 percent diversion from landfill rate, Escobar said.</p>

<p>The trash that gets earmarked for waste transformation gets transported by truck to the Commerce Refuse-to-Energy Facility, a joint project of both the City of Commerce and Los Angeles County.</p>

<p>In the facility the trash gets burned at around 1,800 degrees, heating water that becomes steam which turns a turbine to generate electricity.</p>

<p>"The description is very simple, but the operation is very very complicated," Powell said.</p>

<p>There has been vocal concern about the environmental cost of burning waste. Critics have said along with creating energy, the process creates massive pollution in the form of carbon monoxide and particulate matter.</p>

<p>Proponents of waste transformation, including some at UCLA, point out the advantages of energy creation, especially in contrast to the creations of more landfills.</p>

<p>"It's not as good as recycling or reducing, but it's better than a landfill because you're capturing heat energy from that product in a useful way instead of just burying it underground," Katz said.</p>

<p>Waste transformation is parallel to UCLA's own attempts to create energy using waste material.</p>

<p>The university has an energy co-generation plant, which uses natural gas to create energy, is located behind the university police station at UCLA on Westwood Plaza.</p>

<p>The co-generation in the plant's name comes from the use of excess heat from energy generation for heating and cooling.</p>

<p>Part of the gas that fuels the co-generation is itself taken from the Mountain Gate landfill, located in the canyons above the Getty Center, and is used in the creation of new energy on campus.</p>

<p>"One way to make the impact of landfill a little bit better is as organic material breaks down in a landfill it turns to methane gas and we actually use that," Katz said.</p>

<p>The diverse nature of campus waste leads to different concerns and different procedures for recycling.</p>
