#todo

* <del> add in all photos </del>
* add in all text
* fix tiling issue
* <del> move CSS, JS to separate files </del>
* increase the blur of the background as you scroll down (to make the text more readable), or maybe have a blurred rounded rectangle between the text and the backround, but only behind the text (not covering the entire background)
