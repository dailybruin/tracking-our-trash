		<strong>RECYCLING STORY</strong>
		<br><br>
		Each of the more than 300 trash and recycling bins that litter the university is marked with the same goal: zero-waste by 2020.
		<br><br>
		“It’s a bit ambitious,” said Jesse Escobar, UCLA’s recycling coordinator. “But I think we can do it.”
		<br><br>
		Zero-waste is a plan of action for UCLA and the rest of the University of California to divert 100 percent of its waste from landfills using techniques that include bolstered recycling practices. 
		<br><br>
		The process itself starts with a bottle being tossed absentmindedly in a recycling bin. 
		<br><br>
		But that’s only the beginning of the journey for UCLA’s massive amounts of waste, a process involving multiple coordinating organizations and sometimes thousands of miles of travel.  
		<br><br>
		The double-barreled bins have become ubiquitous on campus, beckoning people to throw their plastic bottles, aluminum cans or scrunched-up midterms into the designated container. 
		<br><br>
		Inside the bin, the bottle is collected, along with the rest of the recyclables, in a clear plastic bag —the clear plastic used as part of a pervasive color coding process.
		 <br><br>	
		From there, the bags are collected by UCLA facilities management personnel, often driving the white square-paneled metal carts seen buzzing around the university’s pathways. The carts putter to a stop at one of the numerous docks associated with specific buildings or one of three centralized pick up locations scattered in the lots and backends of campus. 
		<br><br>
		Loads of bags are then dumped into either a recycling compactor or a three-yard metal bin – both color coded blue – to await pickup.
